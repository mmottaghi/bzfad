# BZ-FAD: A Low-Power Low-Area Multiplier based on Shift-and-Add Architecture

BZ-FAD (ByZ-FAD) stands for Bypass Zero, Feed A Directly. It is the name of a multiplier architecture for shift-and-add multipliers that considerably lowers the switching 
activity of conventional multipliers. The modifications to the 
multiplier which multiplies A by B include the removal of the 
shifting the B register, direct feeding of A to the adder, bypassing 
the adder whenever possible, using a ring counter instead of a 
binary counter and removal of the partial product shift. The 
architecture makes use of a low-power ring counter proposed in 
this work. Simulation results for 32-bit radix-2 multipliers show 
that the BZ-FAD architecture lowers the total switching activity 
up to 76% and power consumption up to 30% when compared to 
the conventional architecture. The proposed multiplier can be 
used for low-power applications where the speed is not a primary 
design parameter
